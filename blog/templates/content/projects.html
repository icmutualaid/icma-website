    <h2>Iowa Queer Prisoner Correspondance Program (IQPCP)</h2>
    <p>The IQPCP provides support to queer people in Iowa prisons by connecting
        them to people outside. The goal of this program is to support queer 
        incarcerated people while they are inside and after they are released by 
        forming long-lasting relationships. We provide funds for stamps, stationary, 
        envelopes, phone calls, o-mail, and commissary.</p>
