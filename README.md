# Contribution and Workflow

If you are an ICMA member, ask someone on the IT committee to add your GitHub account as an owner of the organization, or if you have the [@icma-admin](https://github.com/icma-admin) GitHub credentials, do it yourself on [the organization's Members page](https://github.com/orgs/icmutualaid/people).

Follow [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) (create pull requests with individual fixes and features). Make your git commits using your own GitHub account, **not** the [@icma-admin](https://github.com/icma-admin) account.

If you are not an ICMA member and you're curious, [contact us](https://github.com/icmutualaid).

To manually run tests: `coverage run -m pytest`
